# AES GCM Salamander

What is an AES GCM Salamander: a salamander is an encrypted message that can get decrypted with 
two different keys and the decrypted message differs depending on the key.

So in the end it is possible to change a ciphertext in a way that you cannot rely on the fact that is 
decryptable by a given key. For that reason it is important to have a second check with a digital  
signature that proofs that the ciphertext was generated by the sender.
